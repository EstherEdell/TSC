                    Recovery Model
                </h3>
                <p>
                     The Recovery Model is an approach to mental illness that emphasizes and supports an individual’s potential for living a
                    full life while coping with mental illness. Recovery can be seen as a personal journey requiring hope, a secure controversial
                    persuasive speech topics base, supportive relationships, self-determination, coping skills, and finding meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The use of the concept of recovery in mental health and illness treatment emerged as psychiatric de-institutionalization
                    resulted in more individuals with mental illness living in community settings. It gained impetus due to a perceived failure
                    to adequately support integration into their communities, and by studies demonstrating that many people can integrate or
                    “recover”. The Recovery Model has now been explicitly adopted as the guiding principle of mental health systems in a number
                    of countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A number of standardized measures have been developed to assess aspects of recovery. There is some variation between professionalized
                recovery models and those originating in the consumer/survivor movement. Trinity Square Cafe uses a community-based recovery
                model based on vocational/educational skills building within a community context.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Each individual’s recovery process is very personal and is dependent on an individual’s community and life circumstances.
                Despite this individual nature, there are a number of features that are common core elements of all recovery.

                <h3>Elements of Recovery</h3>
                <p>
                     Each individual’s recovery process is very personal and is dependent on an individual’s community and life circumstances.
                    Despite this individual nature, there are a number of features that are common core elements of all recovery.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="recovery-block">
                <h3>Hope</h3>
                <p>
                     Finding and nurturing hope is a key to recovery. It includes not just optimism but a sustainable belief in oneself and a
                    willingness to persevere through uncertainty and setbacks. Hope may start at a certain turning point, or emerge gradually
                    as a small and fragile feeling, and may fluctuate with despair. It involves daring to trust in yourself and other people
                    and to risk disappointment, failure and further hurt.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="recovery-block">
                <h3>Secure Base</h3>
                <p>
                     Appropriate housing, a sufficient income, freedom from violence, and best tiller adequate access to healthcare are foundations
                    to recovery.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="recovery-block">
                <h3>Supportive Relationships</h3>
                <p>
                     A common aspect of recovery is the presence of others who believe in the person’s potential to recover, and who stand by
                    them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships
                    with friends, family and the community are often of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar
                    difficulties and who may be on a journey of recovery (peers), can be of particular importance. Those who share the same values
                    and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. Sometimes, one-way
                    relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing. Reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be
                    of more value to self-esteem and recovery.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="recovery-block">
                <h3>Self-Determination</h3>
                <p>
                     Self-determination is important to recovery, including having control. This can mean developing the confidence for independent
                    assertive decision-making and help-seeking. Achieving self-determination may require support for recovering unpracticed social
                    skills or making up for gaps in work history.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="recovery-block">
                <h3>Coping Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                     The development of personal coping strategies (including self-management or self-help) is an important element. This can
                    involve making use of medication or psychotherapy if the person is fully informed and listened to, including open discussions
                    about adverse effects and about which methods fit with the person’s life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping
                    and problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which may or may not be seen as symptoms of mental
                    illness) may require a person becoming their own expert, to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to
                    understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Being able to move on can mean having to cope with feelings
                    of loss, which may include despair and anger. When an individual is ready, this can mean a process of grieving. It may require
                    accepting past suffering and lost opportunities or lost time.

            <div class="recovery-block">
                <h3>Meaning</h3>
                <p>
                     Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose is said to be important for sustaining the recovery process. This may
                    involve recovering or developing a social or work role.
